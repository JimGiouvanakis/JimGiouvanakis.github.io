# Self-Hosted Bio Webpage

This project is a customizable self-hosted bio webpage template where users can share links to their profiles or any other content, accompanied by background music and video. It's designed to provide a personalized online presence with a unique aesthetic.

## Features

- **Customizable Content:** Users can personalize their bio with their profile picture, username, user description, and links to their preferred platforms (e.g., SoundCloud, GitHub, PayPal).
  
- **Background Music and Video:** The webpage includes options for background music and video to enhance the user experience. Users can set their preferred audio and video content to play automatically when someone visits their bio.

- **Terminal-Like Interface:** The template incorporates a terminal-like interface for a distinctive and interactive design. It includes buttons for control (close, minimize, maximize) to add to the aesthetic and potentially provide future functionality.

## Usage

1. **Setup:**
   - Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
   - Customize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files according to your preferences. You can modify the content, styling, and functionality to reflect your personality and showcase your interests.

2. **Add Content:**
   - Replace the default profile picture (`default.jpg`) with your own picture.
   - Update the username and user description in the HTML file (`index.html`) to reflect your identity and interests.
   - Add links to your preferred platforms in the HTML file. You can modify the existing links or add new ones based on your online presence.

3. **Background Music and Video:**
   - Replace the default audio (`default.mp3`) and video (`default.mp4`) files in the `assets/music` and `assets/back` directories, respectively, with your own audio and video content.
   - Ensure that your audio and video files are in the correct formats and adjust the `<source>` tags in the HTML file accordingly.

4. **Hosting:**
   - Host the modified files on your preferred web hosting service or server to make your bio webpage accessible online.
   - Ensure that your hosting service supports HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and multimedia file formats for proper functionality.

5. **Share Your Bio:**
   - Once your bio webpage is live, share the URL with friends, followers, or anyone interested in learning more about you.
   - Encourage visitors to explore your bio, listen to the background music, and watch the background video while discovering your online presence through the provided links.
